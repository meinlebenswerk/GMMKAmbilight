We need to check for the current keyboard model (Do we tho?)`

No need to know the full keymap, since the button-ids are just mapped differently?
This will become obvious, later.

Does GMMK know that?

Keymap is stolen from QMK
Code is based on https://github.com/paulguy/gmmkctl
And also https://github.com/Kolossi/GmmkUtil
and a tiny bit https://github.com/dokutan/rgb_keyboard

Now i need to read the german map and the fullsize map
From this i can generate a list of point mappings

This can be made into a texture

And then used in a glsl shader.


-> Maybe like this:
Since the iso keymap has no key-names?
-> But it has a general layout

Maybe i can just generate a vector of points from the GMMK map
And then match them up with the ISO map's points.


Ayy it has rows/columns
-> this can be used to match them up, and then use the coordinates from the json

-> Okay, if i assign the GMMK's keys an x-y coordinate
-> I can use the Matrix to check which key it is
-> and then just take the id from one and the coords from the other


How the fuck does this work??

Take the appropriate location from the image
Average it
And then write it into a buffer, based on key-id.


Probably the best:
Build a blur-shader, which runs atop of the screen-capture
